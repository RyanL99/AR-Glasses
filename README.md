# AR-glasses-project

This is my prototype (still in progress) pair of AR glasses that I recently started building. It is powered by an ESP32 and connects to an Android phone to display notifications and other important information. I’ve already tested the core features and confirmed they work. My next step is to add a camera module so the glasses can take pictures and perform image recognition.

**How to used**
Upload the code to Android Studio. This app controls the ESP32 with an LCD screen. When connected, it displays the current time (updated every minute), receives notifications from the phone, and can send information to the LCD from the phone.
